# Problem Statement

The lack of real-time recognition and response to students' emotional states in classrooms often hinders personalized learning, engagement, and well-being. Therefore, we need an empathetic, privacy-respecting solution that can analyze students' emotional cues for a more supportive learning environment. This study focuses on bridging the gap between educators' understanding of their learners and their social well-being in the classroom environment.

# What We Offer

Real-time detection and interpretation of students' facial expressions.
Valuable insights into emotional engagement, comprehension levels, and overall well-being.
Enabled and tailored teaching strategies fostering an empathetic and inclusive learning environment.
Comprehensive understanding of classroom dynamics and educational insights.
Continuous updates and timely feedback to learners.

# A Fresh Approach

Instead of solely focusing on recognizing facial emotions, we take facial emotion recognition to the next level by creating an interactive emotion-based learning environment. Our goal is to build a system that can detect students' emotions and dynamically adapt classroom dynamics to create a more engaging and supportive learning experience, thereby transforming the landscape of educational platforms.

# Estimated Cost

The primary expense for implementing the proposed solution will be the AI cameras to be installed in the classrooms. The cost of basic AI-enabled cameras in India typically ranges from 10,000 to 30,000 INR per camera. However, for a more extensive setup with advanced features and higher capabilities, the cost per camera can be in the range of 50,000 to 1,00,000 INR or more.
